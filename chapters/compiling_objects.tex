\section*{Compiling Objects}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Objects contain a pointer to a dispatch vector (also called vtable) with pointers to method code. 
	
	\item DV layout of new method is appended to the class which is being extended.
	
	\item Multiple Inheritance approaches: 
		\begin{compactitem}
			\item Allow multiple DV tables (C++), choose which DV to use based on static types, casting requires runtime operations.
			
			\item Use a level of indirection: Map method identifiers to code pointers using a hash table, search up through the class hierarchy.
			
			\item Give up separate compilation: Use sparse dispatch vectors or binary decision trees.
		\end{compactitem}
	
	\item Multiple Dispatch Vectors: Objects may have multiple entry points with individual DVs, casts change entry point of a variable
\end{itemize}
