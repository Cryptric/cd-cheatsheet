Storage Types: local variable \texttt{\%uid}, global variable \texttt{@gid}, abstract locations (stack-allocated with \texttt{alloca}), heap-allocated structures (\texttt{malloc}).\medskip
	
Each \texttt{\%uid} appears on the left-hand side of an assignment only once in the entire control flow graph (SSA).\medskip
	
The entry block of the CFG does not have to be labeled, the last instruction of a block is called the terminator.\medskip
	
LLVM provides the \texttt{getelementptr} instruction to compute pointer values: Given a pointer and a path through the structured data pointed to by that pointer, GEP computes an address - analog of LEA.
$$\texttt{getelementptr <ty>* <ptrval> \{, <ty> <idx>\}* }$$
		
GEP never dereferences the address it is calculating.
