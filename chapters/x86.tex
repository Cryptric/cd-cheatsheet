\section*{x86lite}

x86lite memory consists of $2^{64}$ bytes numbered \texttt{0x00000000} through \texttt{0x0xffffffff}, split into 8-byte quadwords (has to be quadword-aligned). \medskip
	
The stack grows from high addresses to low addresses, \texttt{rsp} points to the top of the stack, \texttt{rbp} points to the bottom of the current stack frame. \medskip
	
Registers: \texttt{rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, rsp, rbp, rip, r08 - r15} \medskip
	
Flags: \texttt{OF} overflow, \texttt{SF} sign (1 = negative), \texttt{ZF} zero \medskip
	
Instructions: \texttt{SRC} before \texttt{DEST} (AT\&T syntax), prefix register with \% and immediate values with \$. \medskip
	
Operands:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \texttt{Imm}: 64-bit literal signed integer
	\item \texttt{Lbl}: label representing a machine address
	\item \texttt{Reg}: one of the registers, the value is its content
	\item \texttt{Ind}: machine address [base:\texttt{reg}][index:\texttt{reg}][disp:\texttt{int32}] (base + index*8 + disp)
\end{compactitem} \medskip
	
x86 assembly is organized into labeled blocks, indicating code locations used by jumps, etc. Program begins execution at designated label (\texttt{main}).\medskip
	
Calling Conventions (SYSTEM V AMD64 ABI)
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Setup Stack Frame: \newline
		\texttt{pushq \%rbp} \newline 
		\texttt{movq \%rsp, \%rbp}
		
	\item Caller Save - freely usable by the called code.
	\item Callee Save - must be restored by the called code (\texttt{rbp, rsp, rbx, r12-15}).
		
	\item Arguments: \newline
	1..6: \texttt{rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r08, r09} \newline
	7+: on the stack (in right-to-left order) \newline
	For $n > 6$, $(n-7) + 2) * 8 + \texttt{rbp}$
		
	\item Return value in \texttt{rax}.

	\item 128 byte "red zone" - scratch pad for the callee (beyond \texttt{rsp}).
\end{compactitem}
