\section*{Lexing}

Lexing is the process of taking the source code as an input and producing a token stream as output. The problem is to precisely define tokens and matching tokens simultaneously.\medskip

One way of implementing a lexer is, using regular expressions. RegEx rules precisely describe a sets of strings. But RegEx alone can be ambiguous if we have multiple matching rules. Most languages therefore choose the longest match or have another specified order. \medskip

RegEx can be implemented forming an nondeterministic automata and then transforming it to a deterministic finite automata.
